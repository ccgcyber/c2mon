# C2MON documentation

Welcome to the official CERN Control and Monitoring Platform (C2MON) documentation.

---

The CERN Control and Monitoring Platform (C2MON) is an open-source heterogeneous time-series data acquisition/subscription framework with alerting and
control functionalities that can be used for building many different types of system. Check out the potential [use cases](overview/#use-cases).

This manual includes concepts, instructions and samples to guide you on how to use the C2MON platform.

We do a constant effort to complete our documentation. If you are missing some information, please write an email to [c2mon-support@cern.ch](mailto:c2mon-support@cern.ch).
