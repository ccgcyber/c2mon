# Building C2MON documentation

The C2MON documentation is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and built using
[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) version 0.17.3. You will need MkDocs installed before building/previewing the docs.

## Preview

To build and view the documenation it is possible to directly use mkdocs:

```bash
$ mkdocs build --clean
$ mkdocs serve
```

The docs will be served at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
